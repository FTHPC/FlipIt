# FlipIt Installation

1.) Obtain a copy of LLVM and clang [here](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html). We have tested with LLVM 3.5.2 source and precompiled binaries. If you choose to build LLVM and clang from source, follow these [directions](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html).

2.) Get FlipIt: 

```
git clone git@github.com:joncalhoun40/FlipIt.git
```

3.) Modify your bashrc file to add directory to path and set some environment variables that are used throughout FlipIt
```
 export LLVM_BUILD_PATH=/path/to/llvm/
 export FLIPIT_PATH=/path/to/flipit
 
 #only required if you want to use FlipIt as a library with other code
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/flipit/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 
 #not required, but can make your fingers happy in you do not use the compiler wrapper
 PATH=$PATH:/path/to/llvm/bin
 export PATH
```

4.) Run script to setup FlipIt with LLVM (Note: If you're not using LLVM version 3.4, the LLVM #include files in [faults.h](src/pass/faults.cpp) might not be correct. This is due to changes in the directory structure in LLVM between releases.):

```
cd $FLIPIT_PATH
./setup.sh
```
5.) Test that everything works:


```
cd $FLIPIT_PATH/examples
./testPass.sh
```

If all worked correctly, 2 + 2 is not 4. If not, check out the [Examples](https://github.com/joncalhoun40/FlipIt/wiki/Examples) wiki page for suggested solutions.
