Information
-----------

Basic analysis scripts that combine injection site, source code, and runtime
injection information to generate graphs about the fault injection campaign.
The scripts read the compiler log files and run output files to store key
information into a database that is used when visualizing the fault injection
campaign.

Such graphs include:
    - Classification of injections based on instruction type
    - Percent of injections based on function (includes type information
    - Signals generated
    - Trials with detection (includes bit locations and types)
    - Latency of detection
    - Trials that unexpectedly terminate (includes bit locations and types)

The scripts are extensible with user defined functions placed in 'custom.py'.
The user can collect information from the run output files being parsed,
e.g. application progress, SDC detector performance, by extending the
database's tables or creating their own, and visualize their data, or
combine data that is already collected into new visualizations.




Usage
-----

These scripts depend on 'numpy', 'matplotlib', and 'sqlite3'.

To use these scripts:

    1.) modify 'analysis_config.py'
    2.) python 'main.py'
